0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget.
  - function Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together mandatory.
  - function Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
  - function Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
  - function Prototype: int factorial(int n);
  - If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error.
  - Factorial of 0 is 1.
4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. 
  - function Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
  - If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1.
5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer.
  - function Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
  - If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.
6. Inception. Is it possible?
  - function Prototype: int is_prime_number(int n);
7. this tasks to 2 tasks advanced.
